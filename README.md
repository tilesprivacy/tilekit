## About

Our mission is to shape the future of software personalization with decentralized memory networks.

Tiles Privacy was born from the [User & Agents](https://userandagents.com) community with a simple idea: software should understand you without taking anything from you. We strive to deliver the best privacy-focused engineering while also offering unmatched convenience in our consumer products. We believe identity and memory belong together, and Tiles gives you a way to own both through your personal user agent.

Tiles is built for privacy conscious users who want intelligence without renting their memory to centralized providers. Our first product is an on-device memory management system paired with an SDK that lets developers securely access user memory and create deeply personalized agent experiences.

We are seeking design partners for training workloads that align with our goal of ensuring a verifiable privacy perimeter. If you're interested, please reach out to us at [hello@tiles.run](mailto:hello@tiles.run)
