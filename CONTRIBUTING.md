### Getting Started

Instructions for setting up a local development environment and building the project are available in [HACKING.md](HACKING.md). Please follow those steps before submitting any code changes.

### How to Contribute

You can contribute in several ways:
- Report bugs or request features by opening an issue
- Improve documentation or examples
- Submit pull requests for bug fixes, refactors, or new features
- Open an RFC discussion for proposals that introduce major features, architectural changes, or significant new areas of functionality

Before starting work, check the existing issues to avoid duplication and to align with current priorities. If you plan to work on a larger change, open an issue or discussion first to confirm scope and approach.
